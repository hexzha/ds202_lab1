####Name:

Ashley Anderson. My github username is ashleyna7. 


####What did the Owner do in the most recent commit? What is the commit ID?

In the most recent commit, Sam created his R markdown file and knitted it. The commit ID is 70e6ba42e5aa73e105afa2b2ab295766316ccb2a. 


####Knit the Owner's `owner_YourName.Rmd`. Are you able to do so without error? If you cannot, what errors did you encounter?

Knitting was a success. 


####Also include one tip for making Git/GitHub easier, or an error/difficulty you encountered.

I encountered a difficulty when trying to set my working direction when there is a space in the folder name. I learned using "tab" eliminates this problem.
